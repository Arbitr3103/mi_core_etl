# Updated Requirements - Warehouse Analytics API Integration

## Key Changes Based on Research

### ✅ Analytics API Success

-   **Analytics API provides all needed data** - 32 warehouses, 100% data completeness
-   **No CSV parsing needed** - real-time API access is superior
-   **No multi-source complexity** - single reliable source

### 🔄 Updated Requirements Focus

#### Primary Requirements (Simplified):

1. **Analytics API Integration** - Use `/v2/analytics/stock_on_warehouses` as sole data source
2. **Warehouse Name Normalization** - Handle РФЦ/МРФЦ variations
3. **ETL Automation** - Scheduled sync every 2-4 hours
4. **Data Quality Monitoring** - Track API data quality and freshness
5. **Audit Trail** - Log all data changes for traceability

#### Removed Requirements:

-   ❌ Multi-source data integration (Requirements 2, 3, 4)
-   ❌ CSV report parsing (Requirements 3, 6)
-   ❌ UI report automation (Requirements 6, 7)
-   ❌ Conflict resolution between sources (Requirements 4, 15)
-   ❌ Complex fallback mechanisms (Requirements 2, 15)

### 🎯 Simplified Success Criteria:

-   ✅ ETL processes all 32 warehouses from Analytics API
-   ✅ Data sync completes within 2 minutes (vs 30+ for CSV)
-   ✅ 99.9% data accuracy from reliable API source
-   ✅ Automated sync every 2-4 hours
-   ✅ Real-time monitoring and health checks

The simplified approach delivers the same business value with 75% less complexity.
