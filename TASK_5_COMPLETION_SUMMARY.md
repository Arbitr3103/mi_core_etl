# Task 5: Update ETL Scheduler Configuration - Completion Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive ETL scheduler configuration with dependency management, enhanced monitoring, and integration testing for the Ozon ETL refactoring project.

## Completed Components

### 5.1 Configure ETL execution sequence ✅

**Implemented:**

-   **ETLOrchestrator** (`src/ETL/Ozon/Core/ETLOrchestrator.php`)

    -   Manages ProductETL → InventoryETL execution sequence
    -   Implements dependency checks to prevent InventoryETL from running if ProductETL fails
    -   Includes retry logic with configurable attempts and delays
    -   Provides comprehensive error handling and rollback capabilities

-   **Cron Configuration** (`src/ETL/Ozon/Config/cron_config.php`)

    -   Defines ETL execution schedules (every 6 hours: 02:00, 08:00, 14:00, 20:00)
    -   Configures monitoring jobs (health checks every 15 minutes)
    -   Sets up maintenance tasks (log cleanup, database maintenance)
    -   Includes alert thresholds and notification settings

-   **Workflow Execution Script** (`src/ETL/Ozon/Scripts/run_etl_workflow.php`)

    -   Command-line interface for ETL workflow execution
    -   Supports dry-run mode, verbose output, and custom configuration
    -   Implements process locking to prevent concurrent executions
    -   Provides graceful shutdown handling with signal handlers

    -   Validates cron configuration before installation
    -   Creates backups of existing crontab before modifications
    -   Supports dry-run mode for testing changes

**Key Features:**

-   **Dependency Management**: ProductETL must complete successfully before InventoryETL starts

    -   Checks ETL execution status and recent runs
    -   Validates data freshness and system resources
    -   Detects stale lock files and oversized log files
    -   Provides overall health status with detailed component breakdown

-   **Enhanced Logging in ETLOrchestrator**
    -   Separate logging for ProductETL visibility processing
    -   Detailed metrics collection for both ETL components
    -   Performance tracking and execution statistics
    -   Visibility status distribution monitoring

**Key Features:**

-   **Separate Component Tracking**: Individual monitoring for ProductETL and InventoryETL

-   **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive system health checks with alerting
-   **Performance Metrics**: Duration tracking, success rates, and resource usage monitoring

### 5.3 Create ETL integration tests ✅

**Implemented:**

-   **ETL Integration Test Suite** (`src/ETL/Ozon/Tests/ETLIntegrationTest.php`)

    -   End-to-end workflow testing with mock API clients
    -   Dependency management and sequence validation
    -   Retry logic testing with controlled failures
    -   Data consistency validation across tables
    -   Performance metrics verification

-   **Test Runner Script** (`src/ETL/Ozon/Scripts/run_integration_tests.php`)

    -   PHPUnit integration with custom validation
    -   Coverage reporting and JUnit XML output
    -   Configuration validation and environment setup
    -   Database connectivity and permissions testing

-   **Database Migration** (`migrations/create_etl_workflow_executions_table.sql`)
    -   Creates workflow execution tracking table
    -   Includes proper indexes for performance
    -   Supports workflow status and component tracking

**Test Coverage:**

-   **Complete ETL Workflow**: Tests ProductETL → InventoryETL sequence execution
-   **Dependency Handling**: Validates dependency checks prevent incorrect execution
-   **Retry Logic**: Tests failure recovery and retry mechanisms
-   **Data Consistency**: Verifies data integrity across all tables
-   **Failure Scenarios**: Tests error handling and rollback procedures
-   **Performance Metrics**: Validates metrics collection and reporting
